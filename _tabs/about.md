I'm a mathematician and data scientist working on AI, real-time graphics, graph theory research, and procedural world generation. Currently, I'm developing a planetary-scale game that serves as a testing ground for real-time generative AI systemsâ€”exploring how AI agents can develop genuine intelligence through environmental interaction rather than scripted behaviors.

My academic background includes mathematics and data science (Harvard, MIT), with previous experience as a founder of a geospatial analytics company that was acquired in 2022 and as a Principal Data Scientist/Principal ML Engineer at other companies. I hold several patents in spatial data processing and have published research in mathematical modeling and machine learning.

The technical focus of my current work includes real-time GPU simulation systems, novel AI architectures that combine large language models with reinforcement learning for emergent behavior, and research in theoretical Graph Theory.

This blog documents the technical challenges and solutions I encounter while working on these projects.

Why the name 'Lixel'? Lixel is a combination of light and pixel, illuminating from fundamental building blocks (pixel), building clarity, agency, and intelligence in a real-time graphics setting. From pixels and light, clarity emerges.
