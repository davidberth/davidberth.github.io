Games are some of humanity's most sophisticated decision spaces. If AI can master emergent gameplay, it demonstrates real intelligence. I'm creating:

1. A real-time generative AI system for games and simulations
2. A planetary-scale strategy game to illustrate this AI system and explore intelligence, emergent behavior, and emotional connections with agency

This blog documents my progress on both projects.
