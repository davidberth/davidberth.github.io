## Summary

Games are some of humanity's most sophisticated decision spaces. If AI can master emergent gameplay, it is demonstrating real intelligence. I'm creating 

1. A real-time generative AI system for use in games and simulations, and
2. A planetary-scale stategy/role playing game to showcase this AI system and explore intellegence, emergent behavior, and an emotional connection with intelligence and agency.

This page details my progress and approach on these two projects.

## Background
I recently left a principal AI scientist role to pursue independent research. After selling my startup, finishing at Harvard, and spending years in AI, geospatial and computer graphics, I'm now applying those experiences to a harder problem: making AI that genuinely reasons in complex worlds in real-time.
